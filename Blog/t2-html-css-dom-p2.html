      <h3> HTML, CSS and DOM - Udacity Tutorial Part Two: My Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>What is grid based design?</strong><br>
            Grid based design uses rows and columns to from the structure of a webpage. The most common layout seems to be 12 x 12 as most web devs use 3, 4 and 5 column layouts. 12 x 12 supports all these. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong><br>
            Responsive design is important because we live in an age where people are accessing the web from any number of different devices. The use of smartphones to browse the internet is increasing at a massive rate. Personally I think that responsive design is especially important from an accessibility perspective. Many people cannot afford to own laptops or desktops, so they use their phones for all digital needs. Certainly this is the case where I grew up. By ignoring principles of responsive design we could be unwittingly perpetuating some quite destructive social tendencies.

        <strong>Semantic structure</strong><br>
            Interesting to note the difference in opinion on the h1 - h6 elements. Some seem to say it comes down to specificity of the content, while others seem to use it as a way to style their headings. It seems irrelevent to use it for styling if we're going to be using CSS to style anyway. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</strong><br>
            Pretty keen to explore the overflow element as well as play more with @media. I have a feeling the latter might take me a while to get used to.
