    <h3>Search Inside Yourself: Musings on Chapter One</h3>
      <p>
        So far I've been enjoying the book, though I find the author does a lot of qualifying before he goes the discussion. It made me think that he thinks his audience is a bunch of people who don't actually want to be reading his book! Maybe he's right...<br>

        Another reflection has been that it's quite confronting for me to read about mindfulness and meditation in the context of making money and progressing your career. Sentences like the following: <br>
    
        
        		<br>"...in other words, what if contemplative practices can be made beneficial both to people's careers and to business bottom lines?"<br>
     	
        		<br>"I hope your journey will be fun and profitable"<br>
        	
 
        <br>It's interesting because I have always thought of mindfulness as one of many practices and tools that could help (for want of a better word) revolutionise the world and facilitate a shift towards a more thriving planet. To me, profit and business bottom lines are not compatible with this, so it's a little jarring to hear someone talk about such things in the context of mindfulness and meditation. 

        Despite this, I can empathise with his attempt to de-hippify the practise, and I appreciate this. Tan is coming from a good place, his wrting is easy and pleasant to read, I'm looking forward to reading more from him.

      	My two minutes of mindfulness were nice and relaxing. I really enjoy meditation, but even after years of trying I still find it very difficult to keep up a regular practice. I appreciate how bite-sized Tan makes it seem. I'm finding that to be quite a theme over the last month or so, breaking stuff into bite-sized bits. So far it's really helping in other areas of my life so I think that this approach to mindfulness will be really valuable.
