        <h3>Reflections on the culture of EDA/CDA</h3>
        <h4>December 3, 2015</h4>
        <p>It's interesting attempting to answer these questions becasue I'm trying to go into EDA with as few expectations as possible. My main expectation is that it is and will be a lot of hard work. It's so different to anything I've ever done before so I feel like my brain needs to get used to thinking in a totally different way, as well as being constantly loaded up with new information. I'm already getting used to being in a perpetual state of confusion! I assume that if I work hard enough, at some point the haze will clear a little and lightbulbs will start going off everywhere. Here's hoping!</p>
        <p>One thing that stuck out for me in Shereef's talk was about a change in mindset from a consumptive sit-on-your-butt way of being to a proactive-empowered-team kind of a mindset. As an environmental campaigner, I'm always trying to promote this way of thinking. It's so much more beneficial to the world and to yourself. It really allows people to feel empowered to create their own future, both in the macro sense and on a day to day level. Awesome. </p>
        <p>I think I'll slot into the culture of EDA pretty well. Already we've talked about gender equality and accessibility. I see the world through a lense that is quite focused on class and priviledge. This is sometimes good and sometimes bad but I already feel a culture of priviledge checking and inclusivity. It makes me feel way more comfortable about attending the next phase. </p>
        <p>I am still pretty nervous about it all. I find remote learning really difficult but I've started reflecting on and noting all the things that make it easier or harder for me. The idea of coming and doing it in person with a big bunch of new people is also really scary! I really resonated when Shereef talked about 'imposter syndrome' it's something that I've struggled with a lot  in life. It can really cripple ones feeling of achievement and satisfaction. Luckily as I get older I'm learning to value myself more and allow the feeling of satisfaction in. Being in a supportive work environment really helps. I think the EDA culture faciliates that kind of an environment, so while I still find all this EDA coding stuff really scary, I'm confident that I'll come out the other end feeling amazing!</p>
