    <h2>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h2><br>

    <p>A responsive site is a website that is able to be consumed easily from any number of devices. The design will change depending on how large or small the screen is.

     Responsive design is important because we live in an age where people are accessing the web from any number of different devices. The use of smartphones to browse the internet is increasing at a massive rate. Responsive design is especially important from an accessibility perspective. Many people cannot afford to own laptops or desktops, so they use their phones for all digital needs. By ignoring principles of responsive design we could be restricting peoples access to information and unwittingly perpetuating social inequalities.</p><br>  

    <h2>What mobile first design is, and why it's important</h2><br>
    <p>mobile first design is about designing for the small, mobile screen first and then scaling up to tablet/desktop. It's good because we tend to get carried away with all the awesome things we can do when designing for large screens but then we have to eliminate a bunch of cool functions when we get to the small screen. In my opinion, I think this could often mean the product starts awesomely and then gets progressively more average. Starting with mobile first however, means that our first design is awesone, and then it just keeps getting more amazing as we start to be able to add more functionality and pretty design to the larger screen. Another good thing about it is that if you're designing from the bottom up like this, your mobile site will be much faster. Instead of shrinking and removing everything as the page is loading, it just scales up smoothly as your screen size increases.</p><br>

    <h2>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h2><br>

    <p>A wireframe is a template we can use to help guide the way we code our webpages. It's useful for keeping on track, understanding which types of grids to use and figuring out semantics early on.</p><br>
