    	<strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong><br>
    	HTML is like the structure of a large tree. If you were to design your own tree, the way is is shaped and structured would be the HTML. CSS would be the way the bark looks, it's colours, the leaves, where each leaf is placed, what colour the leaves are etc. The DOM would be the eyes and optic nerves of the human looking at the tree. The DOM sees the code and interprets it, then spits it out onto the webpage, much like your eyes would process and then give your brain the information that tells you what you're looking at is a tree and shows you what the tree looks like.

		<strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong><br>
		Boxifying your design is simply drawing boxes around all the elements you see in your design. This will help you visualise better how you will design your website in html and css, both of which operate using boxes.
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>What is the box model?</strong><br>
		Content, padding, border, margin. All of these can be sized according to your liking (except content). N.B. It's good to note that margins do not appear to affect the element's background, while the others do.
