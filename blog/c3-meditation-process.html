      <h2>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h2><br>
      <p>
        I've been practising meditation for a few years now, but in I suppose a rather tradtional way. I just sit, take note of my body and focus on my breath for a while. Then I get up, stretch, muse on how I feel (almost always really good) and then get on with my day without paying attention again until the morning (if I'm being disciplined!). For some reason getting 'butt on cushion' has never really gotten easier but once butt is there I enjoy my meditaion immensely. It has helped me a lot during some bad times in my life. Funnily enough though, when I'm happy I dont seem to meditate anywhere nearly as often. This is something I'm trying to work on at the moment. The inclusion of mindfulness in the course has been super helpful. What is different though is that SIY seems to focus on a more constant kind of meditation. Looking forward to exploring this more.

      <h2>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h2><br>
      <p> 
        The differences between attention and meta-attention.<br>
        Sit like a mountain!<br>
        Didnt know that meditation could thicken the neo-cortex.

      <h2>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h2><br>
      <p> 
        Pretty into the creating intentions idea, especially around setting an intention for others. Currently trying it out, will see how it goes! Also, being more aware and mindful about attitude towards self. My favourite part of the whole chapter (maybe even book) is to look at yourself through grandmothers eyes. It's such a beautiful metaphor for self acceptance!

      <h2>Any other musings?</h2><br>

        I really liked his friends theory that happiness is the default state of being. It makes the idea of attaining happiness a lot less intimidating. It's funny that we're all striving to attain something that is the 'default state'. Some part of me thinks its all a bit airy fairy but realistically all one has to do is get out of the city, spend time meditating in nature and this statement becomes much more true.</p><br>

      <p>The weird money bits are still in there! "...maybe meditation can help you get a raise." Eurgh.</p>
