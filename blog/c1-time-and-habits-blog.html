        <h3>Reflections on the culture of EDA/CDA</h3>
        <h4>December 3, 2015</h4>
        <p><strong>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong><br>
        I dicovered the Pomodoro technique just last week. I've been using it almost everyday since and so far it's the most effective tool I've found for focus. Previously I had tried 50, 60 and 90 minute time blocks but I currently have quite a short attention span so the 25min pomodoro block is perfect. Plus 5mins is just the right amount of time to pee and make a celebratory cup of tea!</p>
        <p><strong>What did you find interesting?<strong><br>
        There were three main points I found most interesting: 
          <ul>
            <li>Foggs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8">suggestion</a> to use trigger behaviours to help develop good habits. i.e. After I [existing habit], I will [new habit]</li>
            <li>Duhigg and Sethi's suggestion to keep track of your focus so you can convince yourself you're getting better at it. Start with the behaviour, the attitude will follow</li>
            <li>It's important to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. For me that means that when I get halfway through a Pomodoro I can do a little dance. When I've done a full Pomodoro I'll do a couple of yoga poses and have some chocolate!</li>
          </ul>
        <p><strong>What worked for you?</strong><br>
        I'm still new to this journey but so far the most valuable thing is starting small and allowing myself to feel satisfaction in the little achievments. I'm also finding the Pomodoro technique to be awesome!</p>
        <p><strong>What will you experiment further with?</strong><br>
        This <a href="https://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/">counter-intuitive productivity</a> stuff looks really cool. I've only just skimmed but I'll be looking into it and experimenting over the next week or so.</p>
