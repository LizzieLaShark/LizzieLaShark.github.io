 		<h1>What is 'scope', and how does it work in javascript</h1>
 		<p>
 			In Javascript, scope relates to accessibility of defined functions and variables.<br><b>Global Scope</b><br>If you <i>define</i> 			a variable outside of a function, it can be <i>accessed</i> from anywhere. i.e. you can access it from inside any function. <br>
 			<b>Local Scope</b><br> If you define a variable within a function, it can only be accessed from within that function. Once 					you've put the closing curly bracket on your function, you will not beable to access the variable defined within it again. <br>				Because of the fact that in javascript you can have functions within functions, scope can sometimes get a little bit confusing. 			A good rule of thumb is, if you've defined a variable within a function, you can't use it outside of that function. Even if 				that function is within another function, you can't use it outside of the function is is defined within. This means it has <i>				local scope</i>.<br>
