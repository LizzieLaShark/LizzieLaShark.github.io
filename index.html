        <h2><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h2></strong>
      <p> I just did the informal one. I did it when my friend was telling me about some dramatic stuff that's going on in her love life. She seemed really grateful for a listening ear. When I repeated back to her what I had heard I think she got a bit confused because it's a little out of character, normally that is the sort of behaviour she would observe in me only when I'm facilitating a group. Nevertheless I think she felt really satisfied with the conversation.</p><br> 

      <h2><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2></strong>
      <p>I'm going to try the 12 minute focused attention and open attention technique</p><br>

      <h2><strong>Any other musings?</strong></h2>
      <p>I was interested in his metaphors around experience level. I suppose it made me think about how even though I've been meditating for quite some time, because my practise isnt regular, I'm still at the beginner stage. I basically only meditate when I'm stressed out. I'm trying to use it as more of a preventative thing these days. Watch this space...</p>
